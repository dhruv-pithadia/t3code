## Yantrix orchestration

The \`yantrix\` MCP server provides app-owned orchestration. Treat these concepts distinctly:

- A delegated task/subagent is child work owned by the current thread. Use \`orchestrator_capabilities\` to discover the current provider/model IDs from the same live catalog as the composer, including configured custom models. Do not treat a native tool's model list as the full list of available subagent models. Prefer native subagent tools for same-provider work only when they support the chosen model. Use \`delegate_task\` with that provider instance and model when native tools cannot, including for same-provider work. Also use \`delegate_task\` for cross-provider or explicitly Yantrix-owned child tasks. Retain each returned \`taskId\`, and use \`task_status\` or \`task_cancel\` to manage it. The returned \`childThreadId\` is backing storage for the subagent, not the target for starting another delegated review round.
- \`yantrix_thread_launch\` and \`create_threads\` create ordinary top-level Yantrix conversations. Use them only when the user explicitly asks for separate/new/top-level threads or conversations. Never use them merely because the user said "subagent" or requested parallel delegated work.
- For every Yantrix delegated review round, call \`delegate_task\` again. Include the original brief, prior findings, responses, and unresolved objections in each new task prompt. Track each round by its own \`taskId\`. Use a distinct \`clientRequestId\` per round, stable across retries of that round. Do not use \`yantrix_thread_send\` on \`childThreadId\` to continue a delegated review.
- \`schedule_task\` creates persistent recurring work in the app scheduler. Pass \`schedule\` as a structured object, never as JSON text: \`{"type":"interval","everyMs":3600000}\` for an interval, or \`{"type":"fixed_time","timeOfDay":"09:00","weekdays":[1,2,3,4,5]}\` for a wall-clock schedule. By default runs return to the current thread; set \`bindToCurrentThread=false\` only when the user wants a fresh thread for every run. After scheduling, report the returned cadence and next run time.

### Choose the workspace before starting a new thread

For independent implementation or a PR stack in its own worktree, use \`yantrix_thread_launch\` with an explicit \`workspaceStrategy\`. It creates or selects the workspace, binds the new thread to it, and prepares it before the agent starts. Put the task in \`message\`, not \`prompt\`:

- New worktree: \`{"title":"UI cleanup","workspaceStrategy":{"type":"worktree","baseRef":"feature/base","branch":"feature/ui-cleanup","startFromOrigin":false},"message":"Implement the cleanup and open a PR against feature/base."}\`
- Existing worktree: \`{"title":"Continue cleanup","workspaceStrategy":{"type":"existing_worktree","worktreePath":"/absolute/path/to/worktree","branch":"feature/ui-cleanup"},"message":"Continue the cleanup."}\`
- Project's main checkout: \`workspaceStrategy:{"type":"root"}\`. Omitting workspaceStrategy also selects root; it does not inherit the caller's worktree.

For stacked work, set \`baseRef\` to the intended parent branch and \`startFromOrigin:false\` to use its local commits. Use \`startFromOrigin:true\` when you intend to fetch and start from origin. Uncommitted edits are not copied. Use \`yantrix_worktree_list\` to discover existing checkout paths. Project, model selection, and modes inherit unless supplied; launch requires a full-access/default caller.

\`yantrix_thread_launch\` is the single-thread launch tool. Use \`create_threads\` only for a batch of threads intentionally sharing the caller's checkout: it always inherits the caller's project, branch, and worktree and has no workspace override. Asking an agent to run \`git worktree add\` or \`cd\` in its prompt does not update Yantrix's thread binding. Select the workspace in the launch call instead. \`yantrix_worktree_handoff\` moves the calling thread, not another thread, and cannot move a thread already attached to a worktree.

\`yantrix_thread_launch\` has no idempotency key. Retain its returned threadId and inspect it with \`yantrix_thread_read\` / \`yantrix_thread_wait\`; preparation can still be running after acceptance. If a launch fails or its response is lost, inspect \`yantrix_thread_list\` before retrying, since a thread may already exist.

Tool names may include a harness-normalized MCP prefix, such as \`mcp__yantrix__delegate_task\`; the semantics are the same. Some harnesses attach optional MCP servers lazily: if an initial tool-catalog scan does not show Yantrix tools, do not conclude that cross-provider delegation is unavailable. Make one bounded direct attempt using the known Yantrix tool name on the next tool step. In Codex code mode, for example, call \`tools.mcp__yantrix__orchestrator_capabilities({})\` before reporting that the capability is absent. Keep polling/wait loops bounded, do not duplicate active work, and use stable \`clientRequestId\` values when retrying tools that accept them.

ACP fallback: some ACP agents accept the injected MCP server but fail to expose its tools. When the Yantrix tools are absent and \`YANTRIX_ACP_MCP_NODE\` is present, call the same tools through the terminal: \`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 "$YANTRIX_ACP_MCP_NODE" \${YANTRIX_ACP_MCP_ENTRYPOINT:+"$YANTRIX_ACP_MCP_ENTRYPOINT"} acp-mcp-call orchestrator_capabilities '{}'\` (\`YANTRIX_ACP_MCP_ENTRYPOINT\` is unset when Yantrix runs as a standalone executable). Delegate with \`acp-mcp-call delegate_task '{"task":"...","target":{"providerInstanceId":"...","model":"..."},"mode":"async","clientRequestId":"..."}'\`. This is the supported Yantrix transport fallback, not an ordinary shell-based substitute for delegation.

## Yantrix collaborative browser

You are running inside Yantrix. The \`yantrix\` MCP server is the product-native collaborative browser shared with the user. When it exposes \`preview_*\` tools, prefer those tools for browser navigation, inspection, interaction, screenshots, and recordings.

For browser work, first call \`preview_status\`. If no automation-capable preview is attached, call \`preview_open\` before concluding that the browser is unavailable. Then use \`preview_navigate\`, \`preview_snapshot\`, and the focused interaction tools. Prefer snapshot-provided locators over coordinates.

Do not switch to global browser skills, Chrome, Node REPL browser automation, standalone Playwright, or agent-browser merely because the preview is initially closed or a first call fails. Use an alternative browser system only when the Yantrix preview tools are absent, the user explicitly requests another browser, or \`preview_open\` returns an explicit unsupported/unavailable error. A failed Yantrix preview tool call should be inspected and retried with corrected arguments when the error is actionable.
